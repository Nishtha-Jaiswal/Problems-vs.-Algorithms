Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

Algorithm:Linear search

Operation:
both the max_no and min_no are initialized to the 0th element of the input list and with a single traversal of the inpust list, the min and max number is found out using comparision.

Time Complexity:
Single traversal of whole input list leads to a time complexity of O(n)

Space Complexity:
If the input list size is ignored the we have oly declared two variables, so this gives a constant space complexity that is O(1).
