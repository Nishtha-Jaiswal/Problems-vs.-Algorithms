Rearrange Array Elements

algorithm: merge sort (divide and conquer)

operation:
Firstly the given list is sorted then alternate elements are taken to form a number.
Alternate elements are selected because by doing so we can satisfy the two given conditions that are first, the sum of the numbers should maximum and second,there should be maximum a digit difference between them. 

Time Complexity:
The dominant part of the solution that takes majority of the time is the merge sort algorithm, so time complexity for merge sort is O(nlog(n))

Space Complexity:
We are using a buffer array of the length equal to the number of inputs , so the space complexity is O(n)
